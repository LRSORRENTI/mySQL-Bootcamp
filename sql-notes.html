    <p><em>Why learn MySQL</em></p>
    <p>
        Consistently ranked the most in-demand skill in 
        recent employer surveys, SQL is a fantastic way to increase
         your income and boost your professional development. 
         So many companies today use MySQL, including Twitter, 
         Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Udemy, Slack,
          and many others. Unsure about the difference
           between SQL and MySQL? MySQL is the most popular open
            source SQL database out there, so it's a great choice
             to begin your learning journey. We'll talk a lot more 
             about the difference between SQL and MySQL in the course, but 95% of what you learn about MySQL in this course will apply to other databases such as Postgres,
         Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
